### Biography and Interests

I am a fourth year physics PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working on the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection dark matter experiment.

### Project

I am engaged in several analysis projects in the LZ experiment, including a search for Be7 solar neutrino interactions within our liquid xenon target. In addition, I perform calibrations for the LZ experiment, specifically position-based pulse area corrections and electric field mapping.
